# Charlie AI engineering handoff

Updated: September 20, 2026

## Start here

Charlie production is currently **T87** at commit **`5cbd098`** on `main`.

- App: `https://charlie-deployment.tonydlee.workers.dev/?release=T87`
- Backend health: `https://equity-analyzer-backend.onrender.com/health`
- Repository: `/Users/tonydlee/Projects/equity-analyzer-backend`
- Branch: `main`
- Backend health was verified on September 20 and reported the T87 commit above.
- The Mac launch agent `com.charlie.local-agent` was restarted during T82 because `charlie_local_agent.py` changed. T83 is frontend-only and did not require another restart.

Read `AGENTS.md` before changing anything. Preserve unrelated dirty and untracked files. Do not clean the repository.

## Product intent

Charlie is intended to become the primary research and decision-support workspace for a professional equity investor. It should ingest evidence, preserve source provenance, synthesize information in the investor's voice, maintain investment theses longitudinally, prepare meetings, coordinate bounded research agents, and automate repetitive work without silently making investment decisions or accepting research changes.

The design standard is institutional: concise hierarchy, readable outputs, defensible claims, explicit uncertainty, durable recovery, and usable desktop/mobile interfaces.

## System map

| Layer | Current implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React 18. Most legacy UI and routing remain in `src/app.jsx`; newer workspaces use separate `src/*.jsx` modules. |
| Frontend build | `build-frontend.sh` runs Babel with required block-scoping transformation, then esbuild. Generated assets are committed in `build/` and `dist/`. |
| Edge | `worker.js` hosts static assets on Cloudflare Workers and proxies `/api/*` to Render. `service-worker.js` manages client caching. |
| Backend | Flask/PostgreSQL. `app_v3.py` remains the large central application; newer workflows are isolated in modules. |
| Mac agent | `charlie_local_agent.py`, managed by launchd as `com.charlie.local-agent`. It scans iCloud, handles local sources/audio/catalysts, syncs manifests, and participates in managed collection/recovery. |
| Primary storage | Production PostgreSQL plus user originals under iCloud `STOCKS`, `CATALYSTS`, and `SUMMARIES`. |
| Research collection | Managed AlphaSense browser workflow requires the Mac, signed-in Chrome, and scheduled worker availability. Public SEC/FDA/ClinicalTrials supplements are bounded and provenance-checked. |
| Production deployment | Push to `main` triggers Render backend deployment. Cloudflare frontend deployment is explicit through Wrangler. |

## Latest production changes

### T87 — Improved notes: readable prose, topic tags, and a Q&A log

Commit: `5cbd098` — `Give Improved notes the readability the Original had`

Prompted by a real side-by-side review of a CAH management meeting. Findings from that
comparison, recorded because they bear on priority 3:

- The **Original** asserted "FY27 guidance of 3.5–4% EPS growth exceeds the long-term 3.5%
  target". The transcript never says EPS and never states a 3.5% long-term target; it
  contains Speaker 3's "3.5 to four is above 3.5" and, separately, Speaker 2's "12 to 14%
  long-term growth algorithm". The Original supplied the unit and dropped the conflicting
  12–14% figure. The Improved version flagged the ambiguity and preserved both figures.
- The **Original** also reported "High credibility (8.5/10)" — an invented numerical score
  the Improved rules already forbid — and inferred psychology, reading the CEO's joke "I
  lose lots of sleep for lots of reasons" as evidence of concern about the CVS renewal.
- The **Improved** version was materially less readable: quote-stuffed (eight quoted
  fragments in one CVS paragraph), repeated the same guidance caveat six times across
  sections, rendered broken numbered lists, and carried a far thinner Q&A log.

Neither version is objectively better overall, and no benchmark exists that could settle
it. T87 changes only the Improved pipeline, leaving the original Summary prompts untouched:

- `summary_comparison.py` RULES now make reported speech the default and reserve quotation
  marks for wording that is itself the evidence, at most one short phrase per point. It
  bans numbered lists, and requires each fact to be stated once rather than restated in
  every later section.
- Key takeaways open with a scannable bracketed topic tag, adopted from the Original.
- A new **Q&A log** section reproduces the substantive exchanges in order, preserving
  numbers, hedges, refusals and non-answers, and must say so rather than invent an exchange
  when the source has no real Q&A structure.
- `VERSION` moves to `readable-v2`. `summary_comparisons` is unique on
  (summary_id, source_hash, version), so existing notes are preserved and readable rather
  than mixed with output from a different prompt. Older complete notes now label a missing
  section **Not in this version** instead of a permanent "Waiting…".

Validation: 565 backend tests including a new cross-file contract test that every generated
section is rendered by the workspace, 46 frontend tests, production build, and the section
list verified in the browser against the real `conservative-v1` CAH note.

**No output-quality claim is being made.** The prompt now forbids the specific defects
observed; whether the result reads better on real sources is priority 2/3 work and needs
the user's own comparison on a new run.

### T86 — Summary Lab gives the page to whichever job is in front

Commit: `942407d` — `Let Summary Lab size itself to the task at hand`

The layout was fixed at `330px / 1fr` whatever the state. Measured at 1600px with no
experiment open: the composer had 330px (26%) while the empty "Independent source review"
panel held 962px (74%) and 1460px of height for 120px of placeholder text.

- With no experiment open the page is a single centred 900px column. The composer spans
  it: five intake buttons in one row, source dropdown 850px instead of 280px, and
  Experiment name beside Optional emphasis rather than stacked. The placeholder panel is
  gone; its orientation copy already exists in the page intro.
- While reading an experiment the two-column split returns, because a long note needs the
  width, and the composer collapses to a **New experiment** button. It went from 654px to
  192px, giving the Experiments list 786px.
- Mobile is unchanged in shape: single column, intake two across, fields stacked.

Verified in the browser against the built bundle by measuring the live DOM in all four
states — idle at 1600px and 375px, reading at both — including that the composer expands
on demand and nothing overflows horizontally.

### T84 / T85 — stop control and duplicate Summary Lab runs

Commits: `4065477` — `Let Summary Lab experiments be stopped, and stop duplicating them`,
`3d42157` — `Stop experiments a restart left running`

One real YouTube submission produced **three identical `korean_bilingual` experiments**
over the same 20k-character transcript. Investigated from the live rows, not reproduced.

- Root cause: the pending transcription job lives in `localStorage`, so every tab and
  every reload resumes monitoring it, and each resumed monitor called `startLab` on
  completion. The manual enqueue path had no duplicate guard at all, unlike the automatic
  one, so each POST bought another Opus multi-pass run.
- A Lab run triggered by a completed transcription now carries that job id, unique
  server-side, so every monitor converges on the first experiment. A deliberate Generate
  click sends no job id and still creates its own experiment, which is what
  `docs/summary-lab.md` specifies.
- New `POST /api/summary-lab/<id>/stop` and a **Stop this experiment** button. Cancellation
  is cooperative at the existing checkpoints: `save()` writes `cancelled` instead of
  `running` when a stop is pending and raises, so a stop cannot be papered over between
  stages, and a queued experiment never reaches the model.
- T85: a row left at `running` by a backend restart has no worker to reach a checkpoint,
  so the stop route tries the experiment's advisory lock. A free lock means nothing is
  working on it and the row is cancelled immediately.

Validation: 555 backend tests, 46 frontend tests, production build, Render revision and
Cloudflare marker verified. The duplicate rows were read from production through the
signed-in app; no experiment was started, cancelled or approved during the investigation.

**Known related design issue, not yet changed.** Summary Lab's YouTube and audio intakes
post to the shared `/api/youtube-summarize` and `/api/auto-process-audio` endpoints, which
always write a full original Summary (five sections plus Korean) to `meeting_summaries`
before Summary Lab starts its own experiment. One Lab submission therefore pays for both
an original Summary and a Lab run, and the original lands in the Summary tab rather than
where the user started. That is the current design — Lab compares against that baseline —
but it surprises the user and deserves an explicit decision.

### T83 — Catalyst synthesis becomes a named destination

Commit: `8ea85ab` — `Promote Catalyst notes to a top-level destination`

Catalyst synthesis was reachable only through Automations → Research agents → an
unrouted `Catalysts` pill, under a page heading that read `TradingAgents`. Three names
for one path, and the workspace had no URL at all.

- **Create → Catalyst notes** is now a top-level destination at `#view=catalysts`. It is
  linkable, bookmarkable and restored by the back button; `agentView` was local state, so
  none of that was previously possible.
- Arriving there shows a `Catalyst notes` heading and no TradingAgents framing or sub-tab
  row. The `Catalysts` pill was removed from the Research agents tab, leaving one path in.
- The agents sub-views (`research`, `new`, `batch`, `dashboard`, `history`) are now scoped
  to `activeTab === 'agents'`, so the last-opened agents panel cannot bleed into the
  routed Catalyst destination.
- Catalyst history is fetched on arrival. It used to depend on the pill's click handler,
  which a URL, a sidebar click or an alert action never invoked.
- Saving a synthesis previously ended in a blocking `alert('Saved to Research tab')` that
  named a destination without going there. It now shows an in-page confirmation naming the
  saved document, with a button that opens Library → Research documents.
- Fixed a pre-existing mobile defect on that screen: at 375px the Auto-Pilot `Auto-fire`
  select overflowed the card and overlapped the paragraph. The row now stacks below `sm`.

Validation completed for T83: 46 frontend tests (two new: `catalysts` in `VIEWS`, its
Create-group membership, its label, and `readRoute`/`routeHash` round-trip with ticker),
549 backend tests, production build, and a browser pass against the built bundle at
desktop and 375px. Verified in the browser: the sidebar entry and breadcrumb, the routed
heading, back-button restore, the Research agents tab still intact with no Catalysts pill
and no sub-view leakage, catalyst history loading on arrival, and the Auto-Pilot row
measured as non-overflowing at both widths. No synthesis was run, no proposal approved,
no note saved and no email sent during verification.

### T82 — correct the automatic dual Summary fan-out

Commit: `1dfaf72` — `Scope SUMMARIES fan-out and harden Summary Lab recovery`

T81 fanned every `/api/auto-process-audio` job into Summary Lab. That endpoint serves
two callers, so three real defects shipped with it. T82 fixes all three.

- **Duplicate paid Summary Lab runs.** Summary Lab's own Audio intake posts to the same
  endpoint and then starts its own experiment from the saved Summary. Since T81 each
  such upload produced two experiments over the identical transcript — two complete
  Opus multi-pass source reviews. Audio uploads now carry an `origin` marker, and only
  `origin=summaries-folder` (sent by `charlie_local_agent.py`) fans out. Unidentified
  callers do not fan out, so every failure mode is a missing experiment rather than
  silent duplicate model spend.
- **Summary Lab now adopts an automatic experiment instead of starting a second one.**
  If a completed transcription already carries `summaryLabId`, the workspace opens that
  experiment and says so. This holds even if a stale frontend bundle or an un-restarted
  agent disagrees about the origin marker.
- **Restart durability regression.** T81 moved `_mirror_transcription_state` after the
  two follow-on queue calls. A backend restart in that window left the mirror at
  `summarizing`, so the folder watcher kept the file in the `SUMMARIES` root and the
  next tick re-uploaded and re-transcribed audio that was already saved. Completion is
  now mirrored before the queues run, and the Summary Lab id is mirrored after.
- **False "Summary Lab did not start" alerts.** The watcher polls every 10 seconds and
  decided Lab state from the same response that first reported completion, before the
  fan-out had returned an id. The status route now reports an explicit
  `summaryLabState` (`pending`, `started`, `failed`, `not_requested`, `unknown`), the
  watcher waits out a bounded 60-second `pending` window, and it stays silent about Lab
  for uploads that never requested a fan-out. The database fallback never reports
  `pending`, because after a restart only a recorded Lab id proves the fan-out started.
- **Summary Lab recovery thread pile-up.** Only two experiments run at once, so a
  recovery thread can block on the semaphore for a long time. The 30-second sweep
  queued another blocked thread for the same experiment on every pass. Recovery now
  tracks in-flight experiment ids and starts at most one thread each.

Validation completed for T82: 549 backend unittests, 45 frontend tests, the research
quality self-test, `py_compile` on `app_v3.py`, `summary_lab.py` and
`charlie_local_agent.py`, and the production build. Render `/health` reported revision
`1dfaf726498be5ddde89bac233d7ea712f2fcbe2`, the Cloudflare worker reported
`2026-09-20T82` and served `service-worker.js` at `20260920-82`, and
`com.charlie.local-agent` restarted to `state = running` with a clean startup log. The
two new structural regression guards were confirmed to fail against the T81 code and to
pass now. No paid audio run and no model-backed workflow was launched for validation, so
the deployed fan-out behavior itself is not yet proven against a real recording.

Not changed in T82: automatic folder fan-out still uses Summary Lab's English mode, and
historical files under `SUMMARIES/Processed` are still not mass-reprocessed.

### T81 — automatic dual Summary processing

Commit: `d8c608d` — `Fan out SUMMARIES audio into Summary Lab`

New audio placed at the root of the iCloud `SUMMARIES` folder now follows the established original Summary workflow and also launches an independent Summary Lab experiment from the complete saved transcript.

- The original Summary remains the primary saved output.
- The older Improved comparison continues unchanged.
- Summary Lab receives a separate durable experiment using its own current prompt and settings.
- Automatic Summary Lab rows display `Auto from SUMMARIES`.
- Automatic experiments are idempotent by saved Summary, source hash, prompt version, and output mode.
- Interrupted automatic Lab jobs resume after a backend restart with bounded recovery.
- Lab completion/failure produces a Charlie alert.
- One branch can fail without preventing the other saved output.
- The transcription job records the linked Summary Lab ID, and the Mac completion notification states whether Lab started.
- Automatic folder jobs currently use Summary Lab's English mode.
- Historical files already under `SUMMARIES/Processed` were intentionally not mass-reprocessed because that would create large unrequested model usage.
- At deployment time the `SUMMARIES` root contained no waiting audio, so the first real new file remains the live end-to-end proof.
- T82 corrected this release's fan-out scope, restart durability, watcher notification and recovery sweep. Read the T82 section above first.

Validation completed for T81: 43 frontend tests, 18 focused backend tests, Python compilation, production build, Render health revision, Cloudflare T81 asset, and launch-agent restart. No paid audio run was launched solely for validation.

### T80 — Summary Lab language and email polish

Commit: `14784c4` — `Add Korean Summary Lab modes and clean email styling`

- Summary Lab YouTube intake mirrors original Summary language choices: English, English plus Korean interpretation, and Korean-only output where appropriate.
- Summary and Summary Lab email rendering was consolidated into a clean professional format.
- Removed the teal/blue title banner and `Generated by TDL Equity Analyzer` footer.
- Email content uses black Calibri 11-point styling with bold section headings.
- Existing Summary content prompts were not intentionally changed by this formatting work.

### Recent Summary Lab usability work

- `516be90`: fixed accordion state so sections expand/collapse reliably.
- `360d0b4`: added document, audio, and YouTube intake; converted raw Markdown-looking output into sanitized, readable HTML; improved section controls and mobile readability.
- `212208f`: added professional document formatting, individual section sharing, and previewed email-all-sections behavior.
- `8ea4e4c`: introduced Summary Lab as an isolated parallel experiment using connected iCloud documents, checkpointed long-source review, and five familiar sections: Executive Brief, Key Takeaways, Meeting Summary, Follow-up Questions, and Overall Assessment.

Summary Lab deliberately remains separate from the original Summary workflow so the user can compare output quality before deciding whether to replace anything.

### T77 — catalyst synthesis upgrade

Commit: `7b67700` — `Ship catalyst investor notes, event synthesis and Q&A sharing in T77`

Catalyst synthesis now distinguishes source shapes:

- Transcript/fireside-chat workflow: concise brief, detailed note, Q&A when a real question-and-answer structure exists, and shareable output.
- The Q&A view can hide/show asker and answerer identities; email/save follows the visible choice.
- Multi-document event workflow: reviews the folder's primary and broker materials, then writes one investor-facing event note in the user's voice. It does not narrate which broker said what and does not add BUY/HOLD/SELL labels.
- The event note centers on: My takeaway, What happened, Why it matters, What remains unproven, and What I'm watching next.
- Generated review assets and local comparison tools exist, but some remain untracked local development material; preserve them unless the user decides to formalize or remove them.

### Other important recent capabilities

- Editable earnings recap decks and guided research starters (`73382a3`).
- Versioned investment-case signals, evidence half-life doctrine, falsification/variant/position-divergence views (`4a7805d`).
- Evidence proposal repair with source re-reading, retained checkpoints, concise proposals, and acceptance gates.
- Command Charlie favorites and guided multi-company meeting preparation.
- Managed AlphaSense refresh policies, source preferences by stock/subsector/analyst, explicit restricted-source handling, durable collection ledgers, and bounded recovery.
- UI release audit across primary routes, themes, and responsive widths, followed by readability and pool-capacity fixes. See `docs/ui-release-audit.md` for proof boundaries.

## Current workflows and boundaries

### Original Summary

The established Summary workflow is still active and remains the comparison baseline. It supports saved documents/audio/YouTube, Brief, Key Takeaways, Meeting Summary, Follow-up Questions, Assessment, transcript access, saving/export, and email. Earlier character clipping was removed. Do not casually rewrite its prompts while Summary Lab testing is underway.

### Summary Lab

Summary Lab performs a more rigorous, checkpointed full-source review and produces the same recognizable backbone in a separate workspace. It supports saved Summary sources, connected documents, audio, YouTube, output-language modes, collapsible HTML sections, copy/save/email controls, and automatic dual routing from the `SUMMARIES` folder.

Automatic fan-out is scoped to the folder watcher only. Audio uploaded inside Summary Lab
starts exactly one experiment, using the title, emphasis and language the user chose. If a
recording was already fanned out automatically, the workspace opens that experiment rather
than paying for a second review of the same transcript.

Open question: after several real comparisons, decide which Lab prompt/format improvements should migrate into original Summary. Preserve the original until the user explicitly makes that decision.

### Catalyst synthesis

The upgraded code is deployed. The user has reviewed MMM and ELV transcript examples plus a multi-document MRK event example. Further work should focus on output quality, document-shape classification, analyst voice, and repeatable live comparisons rather than merging it with the unrelated Summary workflow.

### Investment thesis lifecycle

Charlie can store cases, compare new evidence, propose source-backed revisions, repair unsupported proposals, discuss interpretations, show case signals/evolution, and retain guarded revision history. The investor remains the approval authority. Evidence checks reduce risk but do not independently certify management claims or complete factual accuracy.

### AlphaSense automation

The scheduled collection worker is active, but a saved policy or queued request is not proof of completed downloads. The last repeated scheduled checks returned no due managed request. Full unattended coverage across all tickers has not been proven end to end.

Collection requires:

- This Mac to be awake and connected.
- A signed-in Chrome AlphaSense session.
- The scheduled browser worker.
- Explicit verification of company, date range, source type, usage restriction, downloaded originals, hashes, destination, and handoff.

Do not invent observed URLs, counts, downloads, or completion. Never pass provider-restricted originals into model workflows.

## Known proof gaps and next priorities

1. **Run a real dual-summary audio comparison.** Add one new representative audio file to the root `SUMMARIES` folder and confirm that original Summary and `Auto from SUMMARIES` Lab outputs both complete, are readable, and can be emailed/saved. This incurs real model usage and should be user-driven, not launched merely for QA. T82 changed the code paths this exercises, so it is still the live end-to-end proof: confirm exactly one Lab experiment per recording, that the Telegram message reports the correct Lab state, and that the file moves to `SUMMARIES/Processed` once.
2. **Evaluate Summary Lab quality across several source types.** Compare earnings calls, investor meetings, noisy audio, long YouTube transcripts, and non-earnings documents. Capture which sections are materially better or worse than original Summary.
3. **Decide the convergence plan.** After real testing, selectively promote proven Lab prompt/format improvements into original Summary or retain both permanently.
4. **Validate catalyst synthesis on more real folders.** Include single transcript, transcript plus presentation, and multi-broker event folders; score concision, factual attribution, analyst voice, unresolved issues, and PM usefulness.
5. **Prove a complete managed AlphaSense assignment.** Demonstrate browser discovery, source restrictions, original download, iCloud handoff, recap, thesis proposal, and recovery for a real user-selected ticker without overstating unattended coverage.
6. **Improve real-source quality benchmarks.** Current automated checks are useful regressions, not expert certification. Add frozen real-source packs and investor-scored outputs without committing licensed source bodies.
7. **Continue UI simplification.** Navigation and complex evidence workflows have improved but remain dense. Any redesign must be inspected at desktop and mobile widths with real long content. T83 did this for Catalyst synthesis. The same pattern is worth auditing elsewhere: sub-views held in unrouted local state have no URL, no back-button behavior and no way for an alert or sidebar entry to link into them. `agentView`'s remaining panels and the Research agents heading are the obvious next candidates.
8. **Broaden recovery cautiously.** Long-running Summary Lab and several research jobs have bounded recovery; audit remaining model-backed jobs for durable identity, checkpointing, ownership fencing, duplicate prevention, and visible failure. T82 fixed the Summary Lab recovery sweep and the audio completion mirror. Two known gaps remain and are unproven in production: a restart between the saved Summary and the fan-out leaves no Lab experiment to recover, because recovery only resumes rows that already exist; and `recover_once` reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment, so recovery is silently inactive if only a Settings-supplied key is present.

## Safe commands

Never run `pytest`.

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit
npm run test:frontend
.venv/bin/python scripts/evaluate-research-quality.py --self-test
npm run build
```

For focused Summary Lab work, the most recent safe subset was:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m unittest \
  tests.unit.test_summary_lab \
  tests.unit.test_summary_lab_recovery \
  tests.unit.test_summary_lab_enqueue \
  tests.unit.test_summary_lab_email \
  tests.unit.test_summary_lab_fanout \
  tests.unit.test_summary_bulk \
  tests.unit.test_summary_job_status \
  tests.unit.test_research_email_format
```

Use `py_compile` for every touched Python module. Do not start paid research, send emails, or approve research to prove a code path.

## Deployment and operational checks

Current release markers must stay synchronized:

- `worker.js`: `2026-09-20T87`
- `service-worker.js`: `20260920-87`
- `src/app.jsx`: `2026-09-20T87`

After an application change:

```sh
npm run build
git push origin main
npx wrangler deploy
curl -fsS https://equity-analyzer-backend.onrender.com/health
```

If the local agent changes:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.charlie.local-agent
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.charlie.local-agent
tail -80 /tmp/charlie-agent.stderr.log
```

Render may return transient 502 responses while rolling forward. Wait for `/health` to report the exact new commit before treating deployment as complete.

## Repository state warning

At this handoff, `main` is committed through `5cbd098`, but the checkout contains unrelated local/runtime state. Preserve it. In particular, do not blanket-stage or delete:

- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `.omc/**`
- `nohup.out`
- `.DS_Store`
- untracked generated files under `build/`
- `charlie_investment_research_handoff/`
- local catalyst review scripts/assets unless the assigned task explicitly owns them

Always inspect `git status --short`, stage an explicit allowlist, and review `git diff --cached` before committing.

## Suggested first Claude Code instruction

> Continue Charlie from production commit `5cbd098` and release T87. Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` before acting. Preserve every unrelated dirty or untracked file; do not reset, clean, stash, or broadly stage the repository. First audit the latest dual Summary/Summary Lab implementation and report any correctness gaps without launching paid processing. Then continue the highest-priority assigned item, run only the documented safe tests, commit only intended files, update `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`, and deploy only when the change is complete and verified.

## Relevant deeper documentation

- `docs/summary-lab.md`
- `docs/catalyst-workflow.md`
- `docs/catalyst-release-T77.md`
- `docs/alphasense-refresh-worker.md`
- `docs/alphasense-collector.md`
- `docs/charlie-roadmap.md`
- `docs/charlie-command-build.md`
- `docs/evidence-workspace.md`
- `docs/earnings-workspace.md`
- `docs/ui-release-audit.md`

Some roadmap/status documents describe earlier releases. Treat this handoff and Git history as the current production baseline, then use older documents for design rationale and proof boundaries.
